                                I realized most of the children who get into various addictions fall within the range of children entering 
                                either the high school or universities. I have seen very great kids with wonderful talents turning out to 
                                be serious drug and sex addicts. This bleeds the heart of many parents and other significant others who 
                                have higher expectation for their wards as they go higher in the education ladder. This is always the 
                                case because parents and significant others spend a lot of time providing for the physical needs of 
                                these children neglecting the cultivation of very important virtues that will help these younger ones 
                                to make productive decisions as they face new people and new environments with different challenges and 
                                temptations. Apart from the afore-mentioned, the rate of addiction defense rolling on social media erases 
                                the guilt of addiction thereby drawing many including Christian young folks.

                                These and many others inspired the idea of “The Journey to significance”. The BIG question was how to 
                                equip our youth in the churches who fall within the scope of this program to be able to stand the many 
                                temptations they are bound to face at higher levels of education and also how we can use them as 
                                “significance ambassadors” to also impart their peers positively in any educational institution they 
                                happen to find themselves. Even though we are looking at negative peer influence combat, the information 
                                this conference looks at will be useful at all settings of life.

                                This gave birth to the slogan: <b>“Journey to Significance” and the response: “Appointed and Destined for Significance”.</b>

                                thought that it would be very fulfilling to open it to the general public.
